Applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including feature engineering, text preprocessing, and Named Entity Recognition, to improve data usability. Fine-tuned a keyword extraction model using large language models (LLMs) like Llama 3 and Mistral, enabling better categorization and search capabilities. Developed a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with 96% accuracy to identify construction-related job descriptions and designed a tool to analyze job descriptions, predicting injuries and assessing worksite risks. Additionally, built a Python-based cost estimation tool for construction sites to support efficient resource management.",
